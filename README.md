# Personal-Project-Spotlight
HTML/CSS/Javascript "game" to cut some teeth on.

I have been hearing that I really shouldn't be using copyrighted materials in GitHub code, so it will rely on an external file.

On the off chance somebody finds and looks at this, you click on the page and give it a .txt file in the following JSON format, filling in the parentheses with proper links:

<pre>
{
	"list": [
https://www.(Whatever the domain looks like ).com,
(Standard youtube links),
(direct links to images that end in jpg gif png jpg webp tiff bmp)
]
}
</pre>

Then you move the spotlight around the page until something shows up, you look at it, interact with it, then if you move away from it it'll disappear and a new one will show up if you move around for it.
